# ♻️ Reverse Logistics Data Analysis Project with Python and Power BI

> This project simulates a reverse logistics operation using synthetic data to explore operational efficiency and environmental impact. It features a full data pipeline, interactive visualizations, and strategic insights aligned with circular economy principles.

---

## 🧭 Project Goal

Analyze and visualize a dataset representing returned products and their final outcomes (reused, scrapped, or destroyed). The focus areas include:

- Identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Assessing the impact of product types and brands on costs
- Supporting sustainable practices through data-driven insights

## 📈 Why Reverse Logistics Matters

### 🌍 A global challenge with smart solutions

- The world generated **53.6 million metric tons** of e-waste in 2019, but only **17.4%** was properly recycled.

- Brazil ranks among the **top 5** global e-waste producers. In 2020, just **3%** of its e-waste was adequately recycled.

- Companies using reverse logistics report up to **30% savings** in logistical costs.

> 💡 Reverse logistics is a core pillar of the circular economy. Data analytics can turn it into a **competitive advantage** aligned with ESG strategies.

## 🧪 About the Data

The dataset used in this project is **synthetic**, created to replicate typical patterns found in real-world reverse logistics. It includes:

- Returned products (type, brand)
- Final status (reused, destroyed, stocked)
- Logistic costs and revenue
- Delivery times
- Origin by region or weekday

> ⚠️ No real or sensitive data was used.
