## 🧭 Project Goal

Analyze and visualize a dataset representing returned products and their final outcomes (reused, scrapped, or destroyed). The focus areas include:

- Identifying bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Assessing the impact of product types and brands on costs
- Supporting sustainable practices through data-driven insights

## 📈 Why Reverse Logistics Matters

### 🌍 A global challenge with smart solutions

- The world generated **53.6 million metric tons** of e-waste in 2019, but only **17.4%** was properly recycled.  
  _Source: Global E-waste Monitor 2020 (UN)_

- Brazil ranks among the **top 5** global e-waste producers. In 2020, just **3%** of its e-waste was adequately recycled.

- Companies using reverse logistics report up to **30% savings** in logistical costs.

> 💡 Reverse logistics is a core pillar of the circular economy. Data analytics can turn it into a **competitive advantage** aligned with ESG strategies.

## 🧪 About the Data

The dataset used in this project is **synthetic**, created to replicate typical patterns found in real-world reverse logistics. It includes:

- Returned products (type, brand)
- Final status (reused, destroyed, stocked)
- Logistic costs and revenue
- Delivery times
- Origin by region or weekday

> ⚠️ No real or sensitive data was used.

## 📊 Key Insights

### 1. Weekly Disposition Patterns
- Repaired Goods: 1,400 units (23% of total volume)
- Jobber Items: 602 units (43% of total volume)
- Destroyed Items: 470 units (34% of total volume)

### 2. Product Category Analysis
##### The operation handles six main product categories:

- Dishwashers
- Dryers
- Refrigerators
- Microwaves
- Televisions
- Washing Machines

### 3. Revenue by Product Type
- Microwaves lead revenue generation at £9.5K
- Dishwashers follow closely at £9.4K
- TVs generate £9.2K
- Dryers contribute £8.8K
- Refrigerators and Washing Machines each generate £8.6K

### 5. Operational Efficiency
- Average delivery time: 3 days

#### Strategic Implications

##### 1. 🔍 Identifying Bottlenecks and Optimization Opportunities 
- The results presented highlight the need to evaluate current processes and identify inefficiencies that may be preventing optimal performance and resource utilization.

- Certain days experience low performance, suggesting opportunities to redistribute campaigns or increase deliveries.

- Average delivery time can be optimized with routing adjustments or logistics partnerships.

##### 2. 💰 Assessing the Impact of Products and Brands on Costs
  
- Product Focus: Microwaves and dishwashers represent the highest revenue opportunities

- Brand Relationships: Electrolux and LG appear frequently, suggesting these brands either have higher failure rates or larger market share

- Cost Management: Pareto analysis reveals opportunities to focus cost reduction efforts on the 13% of brands driving most expenses

##### 3. 🌱 Supporting Sustainable Practices with Data Insights

- Delivery time impacts and Destroyed products represents logistical emissions, material and energy waste   

- Integrate this indicator into the company’s ESG reporting framework.

- Optimize delivery routes and consolidation strategies to reduce carbon footprint.

- Monitor and reduce product damage rates to minimize waste and improve efficiency.
